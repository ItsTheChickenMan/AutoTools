# each line should follow the pattern:
# PartClassName	partNameInConfig
# or, in words, the type of the part and the part's name as it appears in the configuration on the robot controller app, separated by whitespace, then followed by a new line for each additional part
# to add a new part, simply follow the pattern
# any line preceded by a hashtag will be ignored, and multiple prt files can be loaded (these are the defaults)
