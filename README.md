# How to Use
This works by hosting a GUI client on localhost:8080 through a node.js server.  run `node server.js`, and use a web browser to go to localhost:8080

Note that despite the setup, this is not meant to be hosted for public use.  The web server should only be accessed locally, both for security reasons and to ensure functionality.
