# TODO.md

This project has somewhat reached a "functional" state, or at least in theory (because I haven't actually implemented the default action index yet).  Now that development goals are a little less clear, I'm managing everything that should get done in here so I don't forget to do it

## TODO List:

### High Priority:

- Implement the default action index for four wheel mecanum drive (no odometry?)
- Save/Load paths
- Save/Load action index and prt file configurations (needs to be added every time the program is restarted rn)
- Allow user to create and modify global variables

### Low Priority:

- Compile and deploy autonomous to control hub automatically when exported

### Do For Fun:

- Allow user to download their autonomous as an annotated image of the path (for competition)
