# TODO.md

This project has somewhat reached a "functional" state, or at least in theory (because I haven't actually implemented the default action index yet).  Now that development goals are a little less clear, I'm managing everything that should get done in here so I don't forget to do it

## TODO List:

### High Priority:

- Implement the default action index for four wheel mecanum drive (no odometry?)
- Save/Load paths
- Save/Load action index and prt file configurations (needs to be added every time the program is restarted rn)

### Low Priority:

- New alert system other than just using alert() (because html alerts are fairly irritating)
- Compile and deploy autonomous to control hub automatically when exported

### Do For Fun:

- Allow user to download their autonomous as an annotated image (to show at comp)
- Sort files a bit better
- Make README a bit more descriptive and helpful
- Workaround for bad javascript floats (large amounts of trailing decimals like 108.86399999999999)
- Fix documentation (flips too often between verbose javadoc style and quick dev comments)
- Got through all TODOs and FIXMEs
- Find a better name than "AutoTools"
