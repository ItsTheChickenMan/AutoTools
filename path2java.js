// path2java
// converts a path produced by the client GUI into java source code
// AKA the meat and potatoes of the project (I guess the GUI is the real cool part but whatever)

// converts a path into java.  requires the path and the actionIndexes in use
// the output is actually a buffer, it doesn't get written to a file by default
function path2java(path, actionIndexes){
	// load templates + sort action indexes
